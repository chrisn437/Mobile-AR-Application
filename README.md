# Mobile-AR-Application

This is a semester project which I did with a fellow student @Anna.
We developed a mobile AR app in the edutainment sector that teaches people the basics of photography.
Therefore, we created a character in Mixamo and recorded movement with the Rococo MoCap suit in an AAU laboratory.
We then developed an App for iOS within Unity where people can place the character, which explaines the basics of photography.
To make it more interactive, the user can guide to specific locations (we distinguished between a nature and city route
based on the preferences which the user can decide), do a quiz about the information given from the character, decide if he 
takes pictures with a phone or camera (based on that decision the user gets different information), see a galary of
example pictures, and read information about the locations all within the app.
